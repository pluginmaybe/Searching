# Some simple Search Algorithms

### Binary and Linear
Basic C# implementations, using generics, of the well-known search algorithms.

### LinkList
Basic C# implementation, using generics, of a singly linked list.
Includes methods
<ul>
  <li>AddToHead - Adding to the start of the list</li>
  <li>AddToTail - Adding to the end of the list</li>
  <li>PeakHead - Get value at head without deleting it</li>
  <li>Contains - return true or false if a value is in the list</li>
  <li>RemoveHead - Returns the value of the head node and removes it from the list</li>
  <li>RemoveTail - Returns the value of the tail node and removes it from the list</li>
  <li>RemoveValue - Attempts to remove by a value. Returns true if item is found in list and successfully removed</li>
</ul>
